{"name":"Dateselector","tagline":"jQuery-based date select field. More ergonomic than classic datepickers for past dates like birthdays...","body":"## DateSelector\r\n\r\nDatepickers are great, that's right. But in some cases it's not intuitive at all.\r\nFor example when you want to get a user's birthday, online selects or dropdowns are a lot much better.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this plugin is to easily build that kind of form fields for date input.\r\n\r\n## Code Example\r\n\r\n**HTML**\r\n```html\r\n    <head>\r\n        <link href=\"path/to/plugin/dateselector.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <div id=\"element\"></div>\r\n        <script src=\"path/to/plugin/dateselector.js\"></script>\r\n    </body>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**JAVASCRIPT**\r\n```javascript\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n        $('#element').dateSelector();\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIt's a jquery-based plugin, so the only thing you have to import in your project are a jQuery version and dateselector.js (and dateselector.css if you want to use the plugin style).\r\nBootstrap & Foundation aren't required at all, they're in the repo only for demo purpose.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe plugin will be under MIT License","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
